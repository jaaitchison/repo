                                    The injury risk in Karate is lower than in most other sports. All contact is controlled and the most you would expect is the occasional lump or bruise. Our classes are meant to teach Karate - thus Gung-Ho bone breakers and street thugs are not welcome,
                                    and you wont find them in our classes. Broken bones and noses as well as knee and joint injuries common with most popular sports are in fact very uncommon in Wado Kia Karate.

                                    It is the responsibility of the instructor to ensure a safe environment for his students. We as a club are proud to state that in the years that we have been running and the countless numbers of students who have and are being taught karate. We have had
                                    no serious injuries to our students.

                                    No, not as a full language, however a number of terms and names of the movements are in Japanese, but the introduction to the terms and names in Japanese will be a made in a gradual process that will come easily to any person of any age. In some karate
                                    dojo&#39;s (sports Hall) and clubs the use of all Japanese terms can be taken to the maximum. However you will find that most karate clubs use English along side Japanese terms.
